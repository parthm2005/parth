        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>India Gate is designed in a blend of Indo-Islamic and colonial styles. The arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge cornice, beneath which is inscribed the dedication: "To the dead of the Indian armies who fell and are honored in France and Flanders, Mesopotamia and Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East and in sacred memory also of those whose names are here recorded and who fell in India or the North-West Frontier and during the Third Afghan War."</p>

The foundation stone was laid in 1921, and the monument was completed in 1931.
